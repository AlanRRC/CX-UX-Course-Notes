# Module 10: Digital Accessibility
{: .no_toc }

Digital accessibility refers to the practice of designing and developing digital content and technologies in a way that ensures equal access and usability for individuals with disabilities. It involves creating websites, applications, documents, and other digital products that can be perceived, operated, and understood by a diverse range of users, including those with visual, auditory, motor, or cognitive impairments. ![Accessibility](access.JPG)

## Outcomes

Upon completion of this module, you should be able to:

- Evaluate the importance of digital accessibility in software development and how it can be implemented to create inclusive software solutions.

## Removing Barriers for Inclusive Experiences

Digital accessibility aims to remove barriers and provide inclusive experiences for people with disabilities, allowing them to fully participate in the digital world. It encompasses various aspects, including:

1. **Perceivable**: Ensuring that information and content can be perceived by all users, regardless of their sensory abilities. This involves providing alternatives for non-text content (such as images or videos), using appropriate color contrasts, and offering captions or transcripts for audio and video content.

1. **Operable**: Designing interfaces and navigation that can be operated using different input methods, such as keyboard-only navigation or voice commands. This ensures that users with motor impairments or those who cannot use a mouse can still access and interact with digital content effectively.

1. **Understandable**: Presenting content and functionality in a clear and understandable manner. This includes using plain language, organizing information in a logical and consistent manner, and providing instructions and feedback that are easy to comprehend.

1. **Robust**: Ensuring that digital content and technologies are compatible with a variety of assistive technologies and different platforms. This involves following standard web development practices and using technologies that support accessibility, such as properly structured HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

By implementing digital accessibility principles, organizations and developers can create an inclusive online environment, promote equal opportunities, and provide individuals with disabilities the ability to fully engage with digital content, services, and interactions.

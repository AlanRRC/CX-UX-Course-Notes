## Objectives

Upon completion of this module, you should be able to:

- Explain the purpose of a JS component library.
- Describe what a component is within the context of React.
- Write and render valid JSX markup.
- Build simple React components with configuration properties.
- Make use of loops and conditional within your components.
- Develop React components in your browser using CodePen. (See below üëá)

## Local vs Cloud Development

![Local vs Cloud Development](social-32-512.png){:class="small inline"}

Developing React applications locally on your laptop means installing and configuring the **Node.js** package manager **npm**.

We're going to skip local development, for now, in favour of building cloud-based React apps with [CodePen.io](https://codepen.io/).

_"CodePen is a social development environment for front-end designers and developers. Build and deploy a website, show off your work, build test cases to learn and debug, and find inspiration."_

üì¢ **Note:** [Sign-up for a CodePen account](https://codepen.io/accounts/signup/user/free) so that you can save your work.

## CodePen - Live Code Examples

Some of code examples in these notes are embedded **CodePens**.

By the end of these notes you'll be able to build components like the `Country` component shown here:

<p class="codepen" data-height="330" data-theme-id="light" data-default-tab="js" data-user="stungeye" data-slug-hash="RwrKePZ"  data-pen-title="Simple React Component with Props">
  <span>See the Pen <a href="https://codepen.io/stungeye/pen/RwrKePZ">
  Simple React Component with Props</a> by Kyle Geske (<a href="https://codepen.io/stungeye">@stungeye</a>)
  on <a href="https://codepen.io">CodePen</a>.</span>
</p>

üì¢ **Note:** Click ‚Äúedit on codepen‚Äù (top right corner) to mess around with the code. Try styling the component in the CSS tab.

## CodePen Template

You can create your own React componets in the browser using CodePen with this starter template:

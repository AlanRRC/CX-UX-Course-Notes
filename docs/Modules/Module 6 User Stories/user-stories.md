# Module 6: User Stories
{: .no_toc }

User stories are a technique commonly used in software development and project management to capture requirements from the perspective of end users or stakeholders. They are concise descriptions of a specific functionality or feature that a software system should possess, written from the user's point of view.

## Outcomes

Upon completion of this module, you should be able to:

- Compose user stories that capture specific features and functionality from the perspective of end users to inform the development process.

## A Simple User Story Template

A user story typically follows a simple template that includes three components:

1. **Role**: This describes the type of user or stakeholder who will benefit from the feature or functionality.
1. **Goal**: This explains what the user wants to achieve or the problem they want to solve using the software.
1. **Benefit**: This outlines the value or benefit the user will gain from the feature or functionality.

Here's an example of a user story for an online shopping application:

User stories are often written on small index cards or sticky notes, which can be easily organized and prioritized in a product backlog. They serve as a starting point for discussions between the development team, product owner, and stakeholders, helping to elicit and refine requirements, prioritize work, and ensure that the developed software meets the needs and expectations of the users.

For years there wasn't an easy standard way to import [open-source](https://opensource.com/resources/what-open-source) code into a Javascript project.

Even if you were able to integrate an open-source library into your code, keeping the library code updated with bug fixes and security patches was a pain.

In these notes you'll learn how to structure your Javascript code into modular components and how to import open-source modules written by others.

## Objectives

Upon completion of this module, you should be able to:

- Store data in variables and constants.
- Output strings to the screen with `echo`.
- Interpolate variables in strings.
- Use comments in your PHP code.
- Define your own functions.
- Store and retrieve single and multi-dimensional array data.
- Store and retrieve hash data.
- Code various conditional and looping structures.
- Understand PHP's scoping rules.
- Use short echos and the PHP alternative syntax.

## Conventions

All source code in the notes will be syntax highlighted like so:

```php
<?php
    $beers_on_the_wall = 99;
    $beers_on_the_wall--; // Take one down, pass it around.
    echo $beers_on_the_wall . " bottles of beer on the wall.";
?>
```

The output obtained by running the source through an interpreter will be displayed in a monospace font on a grey background:

```
98 bottles of beer on the wall.
```

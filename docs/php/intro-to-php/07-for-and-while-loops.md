## For Loops

A for loop is a counting loops that executes a block of code until a test becomes false. In PHP a for loop works pretty much as you would expect it to.

```php
<?php

    for($i = 100; $i > 0; $i--) {
        echo $i;
    }
?>
```

## While

A while loop repeatedly executes a block of code while the supplied boolean expression is true.

```php
<?php

    $i = 1;
    while ($i <= 10) {
        echo $i++;
    }

    echo 'Oh my, a humdrum example if I ever saw one.';

?>
```

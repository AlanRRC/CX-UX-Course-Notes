# Introduction to React

In the early days of the web all HTML was stored or generated on the server. As websites grew in complexity, developers began to use Javascript to dynamically change a page's markup.

In recent years a number of Javascript libraries have been developed to make browser-generated markup easier to manage.

In this module we will explore this style of "client-side" web app development using [React](https://reactjs.org/), an open-source UI library sponsored by Facebook.
